# Automatic Sprayer
By Anthony Brogni

This is my Automatic Sprayer project. I made the first prototype of this project back in 2017, but I was unsatisfied with the results and so I decided to go back and improve it. This project is an Arduino-controlled automatic sprayer that can be used to keep plants and pets hydrated while you're away from home. When you first plug it in you are prompted to configure your system, and then after that you're good to go! Some nice built-in features are spray schedule and spray duration control, a visual count-down clock until the next spray, and a manual spray button.

Parts Used: 3D Printed stand for the sprayer that also houses the electronics, Arduino Mega, 2.8" tft lcd Shield, Relay Module, 3.3v/5v Power Supply Module, Motorized Spray Bottle, and Wire.

Code Used: All of the code for this project is in a single .ino script that is run by the Arduino Mega.
